## Curriciulum Vitae

I was born in 1981 in London, United Kingdom.  I attended St Edward's Comprehensive in Romford, Essex and then Havering Sixth Form College, Upminster, where I studied chemistry, biology, mathematics and music and general studies, achieving two A's and three B's at A-Level. 
 
After leaving sixth form college, I went to work for DSTL at Porton Down, Salisbury for a year gaining experience in an organic chemistry laboratory. 
 
I was accetped to read chemistry at Worcester College, University of Oxford in an undergraduate masters program (MChem) where I gained a first class degree, was a choral exhibitioner and won the Turbutt Prize for practical organic chemistry.  In my final year I performed research with Professor David Manolopolous (FRS) in computational chemistry. 
 
After that I attended Harvard University and gained a Science Masters (S.M.) degree in applied physics. 
 
Upon finishing my second masters I entered the energy consulting industry where I worked for four years before deciding I wanted to get back into science and maths and became a tutor.
