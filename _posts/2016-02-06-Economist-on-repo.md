The Economist [reports](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21690020-reproducibility-should-be-sciences-heart-it-isnt-may-soon) on a new online journal dedicated to publishing " confirmatory and non-confirmatory studies in biomedical research", called [*Preclinical Reproducibility and Robustness Channel*](http://f1000research.com/channels/PRR). They note that replicating others' results has the following disincentives: 

1. it's tedious,
1. it's not well funded, 
1. and it's not good for researchers' careers.

This journal will hopefully provide a way of starting to mitigating the effects of (3) and, down the line, (2), but how much of an affect this has still depends on the attitudes of hiring committees towards the journal which in turn depends on the impact factor of the journal.  These two factors appear to influence each other so it is hard to predict the future impact of this journal. 


On a side note, the journal seem to be using the term *reproducibility* to mean what Roger Peng is (I think, usefully, redefining) as [*replicability*](http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/405.full).  *Reproducibility* is a weaker term to *replicability* and refers to taking results and reproducing the conclusions.  *Replicability* refers to generating new data and replicating findings.
